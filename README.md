## Schedule of our session

Below is a rough schedule for the breakout session.

**<i>2:30-2:33</I>** - Presenter introductions

**<i>2:33-2:50</i>** - **Class time!** - We will present some materials using an RMarkdown file. The materials are chosen to reasonably mimic a typical class.

**<i>2:50-3:15</i>** - Class structure discussion. We will overview the history of the class including its recent increase in enrollment and the adoption of pseudo-inverted classroom design.

**<i>3:15-3:35</i>** - Back to class, participants will go to Zoom Breakout rooms to have the opportunity to work on the "in-class assignment". The three presenters will work as faculty hopping around breakout rooms to help and discuss.

**<i>3:35-3:45</i>** - Open discussion of all that is covered. 


## Software needed

In this session we will be using the R language for Statistical Computing and RStudio (an IDE for coding in R). Specifically we will be working with RMarkdown. For those interested in participating please install:

* R from https://cran.r-project.org/
* RStudio from https://rstudio.com/

### R Packages

In addition to the base language of R, we will use the following add-on packages

* tidyverse
* ggfortify
* GGally
* knitr

You can install all these packages in R/RStudio with the command `install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggfortify", "GGally", "knitr") )`.  If asked to install from source, select No.
