Materials for the USCOTS 2021 breakout session, "A second course in statistics: Bridging data science and statistical modeling," will be made available here.

## Schedule of our session

*2:50-3:15* - Class structure discussion. We will overview the history of the class including its recent increase in enrollment and the adoption of pseudo-inverted classroom design.
*3:15-3:35* - Back to class, participants will go to Zoom Breakout rooms to have the opportunity to work on the "in-class assignment". The three presenters will work as faculty hopping around breakout rooms to help and discuss.
