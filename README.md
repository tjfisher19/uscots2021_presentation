**<i>3:15-3:35</i>** - Back to class, participants will go to Zoom Breakout rooms to have the opportunity to work on the "in-class assignment". The three presenters will work as faculty hopping around breakout rooms to help and discuss.

**<i>3:35-3:45</i>** - Open discussion of all that is covered.
